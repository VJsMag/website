VJs TV created in 2011 and VJs Mag created in 2013 by [Guillaume Lauzier](https://guillaumelauzier.com) out of passion for vjing, VJs Mag is a digital publication dedicated to exploring and promoting audiovisual art forms. Our team is made up of artists, professionals, and enthusiasts who are passionate about the intersection of sound and visual media. We strive to provide a platform for creators and audiences to connect, share knowledge, and discover new and exciting work in the field.

Our content includes interviews with industry leaders, reviews of new and emerging technologies, and profiles of up-and-coming artists.

We have now implemented a contribution system using GitHub for audiovisual art journalists and content producers. This fair and transparent contribution system encourages anyone to join the team and contribute. More information is available on our [documentation page](https://vjsmag.com/documentation/).

We aim to support the community of audiovisual artists, event organizers, and communities. We hope that VJs Mag will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in audiovisual art forms, and we welcome you to join us in our mission to celebrate and support the vibrant world of AV art.
