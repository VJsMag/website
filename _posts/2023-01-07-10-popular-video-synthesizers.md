A video synthesizer is a device that allows users to create and manipulate video signals in real-time. It has a range of modules that can be used to generate, process, and output video signals. These modules can be used to input video from external sources, generate video signals internally using techniques such as geometric patterns and color gradients, manipulate the video signals with effects such as compositing and image warping, and output the processed video signals to displays or recording devices. Video synthesizers are often used in VJing, where they are used to create and manipulate visual elements in real-time during live music performances or other events.

They have a long history, dating back to the 1960s when the first video synthesizers were developed by pioneering artists and engineers. Since then, a number of different video synthesizers have been produced, each with its own unique capabilities and features.
